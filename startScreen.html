                <h5>Yahtzee Rules</h5>
                <p>
                    The game consists of a number of rounds. In each round, a player gets three rolls of the dice, 
                    although they can choose to end their turn after one or two rolls. After the first roll the 
                    player can save any dice they want and re-roll the other dice. This procedure is repeated after 
                    the second roll. The player has complete choice as to which dice to roll. It is possible to 
                    re-roll both dice that were or were not rolled before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13 different category boxes and in each round, after the third roll, 
                    the player must choose one of these categories. The score entered in the box depends on how well 
                    the five dice match the scoring rule for the category. Details of the scoring rules for each category 
                    are given below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13 scoring boxes divided into 2 parts.
                </p>
                <h6>Part 1</h6>
                <p>
                    In the first part there are six scores. Each of these scores is determined by adding the total 
                    number of dice matching the selected category. The categories correspond to each respective dice face.
                    As an example, if three of your five dice rolled a 3, and you choose to add this result to the part 1 
                    category "Threes" you will get a score of
                    9 ( = 3 * 3).
                </p>
                <img src="./assets/media/images/yahtzeeRulesTablePart1.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    If a player scores a total of 63 or more points in these six categories from part 1, a bonus of 
                    35 is added to the upper section score. Although 63 points corresponds to scoring exactly 
                    three-of-a-kind for each of the six boxes, a common way to get the bonus is by scoring 
                    four-of-a-kind for some numbers so that fewer of other numbers are needed. 
                </p>
                <h6>Part 2</h6>
                <p>
                    The second part contains a number of poker-themed categories with specific point values. 
                    As an example, one of the categories is called Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category 
                    means that a player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the same value. The game is 
                    completed after 13 rounds by each player, with each of the 13 boxes filled. The total score is 
                    calculated by summing all thirteen boxes, together with any bonuses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Chance category is often used for a turn that will not score well in any other category.
                </p>
                <p>In this version we have also added two other categories to this section:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One pair: At least 2 dice the same. Score is the sum of the highest matching pair.</li>
                    <li>Two pair: 2 pairs of 2 matching dice. Score is the sum of the two pairs.</li>
                </ul>
